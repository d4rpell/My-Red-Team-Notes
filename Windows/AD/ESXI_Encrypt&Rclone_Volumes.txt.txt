ESXI Volume Encryption:

You can mount it through rclone .Check out their documentation.  I did this with cloud storage.
Link offhand: https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/
The virtual machine files are located in /vmfs/volumes, just pay attention that you only need to encrypt those folders to which there are links (shortcuts), otherwise you will kill the system.

Contents of Volumes on the ESXI (ESXi01_Local, vmdata) are the volumes that should to crypt.
